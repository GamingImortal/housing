      <h5>
        The Off-Campus Accommodation Finder System is a web-based platform
        developed by students from the University of Zimbabwe to address the
        challenges faced by university students in securing safe, affordable,
        and suitable off-campus housing. <br></br>
        <br></br>Our mission is to simplify the accommodation search process by
        connecting students directly with property owners and managers through a
        centralized, user-friendly platform.<br></br>
        <br></br> We recognized that many students struggle with limited
        on-campus housing, unreliable traditional search methods, and risks such
        as fraudulent listings and lack of transparency in rental agreements.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Our system bridges this gap by offering: A searchable database of
        verified accommodation options tailored to student preferences like
        location, price, and property type. Tools for landlords to easily list
        and manage their properties, reaching a wider student audience. Features
        that enhance safety and transparency. Up-to-date listings and detailed
        property visuals to help students make informed decisions.<br></br>
        <br></br> Our platform benefits a wide range of stakeholders: Students
        save time and avoid the stress of searching for accommodation, with
        access to reliable information and secure transactions. Landlords can
        efficiently advertise and manage their properties, ensuring they rent to
        verified student tenants. Universities and property managers gain
        insights into student accommodation trends through analytics and
        reporting tools.<br></br>
        <br></br> We are committed to providing a comprehensive, accessible, and
        secure solution that improves the off-campus living experience for all
        students. By leveraging modern technology and focusing on the unique
        needs of the university community, we aim to make finding and managing
        student accommodation easier, safer, and more transparent for everyone
        involved
